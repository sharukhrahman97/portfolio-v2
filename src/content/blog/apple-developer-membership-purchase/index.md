## Introduction

Trouble puchasing the Apple developer membership?, you are not alone and i have wasted many days to get a response from the Apple developer support (it won’t be helpful in any way) (why this long, well developer support page most of the time doesn’t have a call option and email will make you wait for 2 to 3 working days) and it drove me nuts. This blog is going to be a long and bumpy ride for some people and a lighthouse for your titanic, so don’t skip if you want to measure thrice, cut once.

## Prerequisites

1. I assume that you already have an Apple ID in your Mac computer and make sure if you are on the [latest OS](https://www.apple.com/in/macos) (don’t be a Beta user as it will raise unnecessary issues) and download the following.
    - Xcode
    - Developer
    - TestFlight (if you want to test macOS app)
    - Transporter (if you want to upload your non native app to App Store)
    - WhatsYourSign (to verify signatures of your non native build)

2. Sign in your [Apple ID](https://appleid.apple.com/) to all the above apps and in Music go to the account menu and authorize this computer. Check if the trusted devices show up in your Apple ID , devices tab and also in *App store account settings → computer authorization → manage devices*.
3. Edit any details that contain any symbols (should only contain alphanumeric, periods and commas), turn on 2fa, add a trusted phone number, fill out gender and turn on iCloud analytics.

## Purchasing the developer membership

In this next part, you might encounter some challenges. If things don’t go smoothly, don’t hesitate to give Apple developer support a call. Choose the right topics when calling because there won’t be a transfer to other support staff. Make sure to remember the case ID so you can check back later.

1. Proceed by adding only one [payment methods](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202631)  in the App store, check out the available payment methods and choose a payment method according to your region. But beware, for some regions only couple of payment methods will work in order to purchase the membership account, so if you are not sure feel free to contact the [Apple developers support ](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/HT202631) and select Membership and Account → Program purchase and renewal and make a quick call. If you are sure, then go to App store account settings → manage payments and go through your preferred payment method process.

    > **Info:**
    At this point, you are just adding a payment methods and not making any payment. If your payment  process insists on adding funds then something is wrong with the process so just skip it, because you have only a 50% chance of purchasing using Apple ID funds that too using an iPhone so don’t risk it. In India, only UPI payments with mandate will be supported to purchase the membership account as of now.

2. Now we’re about to make the purchase, as shown in the above image try purchasing on an iPhone first, if this fails, or you don’t have any of the above devices then try on a Mac computer, open the Developer application and go to account → enroll . This will ask all the authentication and details, and then it’ll ask about mode of registration (If you are registering as an individual the membership account process will be faster and if you are registering as an organization then you’ll be needing a [DUNS](https://developer.apple.com/support/D-U-N-S/) number, and it’ll take longer time for the purchase) and it will proceed to payment, with the exact fees showing on the screen. Click on buy and turn on automatic payment renewal (if available), if you are using UPI make sure it’s on mandate payment mode.

    > **Tip:**  While payment you shouldn’t be entering the fee you’ll be asked to pay with the exact amount, else contact the Apple developer support. If you encounter with the infamous ‘unknown error‘ while clicking on the enroll button, check your data across your Apple ID

payment methods → View details and click on copy billing address checkbox, App store account settings and your system preferences and make sure everything is similar down to a period.

3. After a successful purchase, you will receive a mail regarding your payment, and check your status . Usually it says to wait for 24–48 hours to confirm, but sometimes it’ll reflect in a couple of hours. If you are unsure about the payment status, then visit [here](https://reportaproblem.apple.com/) and see if your payment is listed.

    > **Note:** If it takes more than 48 hours, contact the Apple developer support for the delay, usually they will ask for user’s ID proof for further verification.

4. Agree your [Apple Developer Agreements](https://appstoreconnect.apple.com/agreements/#/)to proceed further

    > **Warning:** There are some people who offer services just to purchase an account for you, don’t fall for the trap.
